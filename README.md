# Lobby Informational Dashboard

This repo contains the JavaScript code for the <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>-based project I developed as a side project for my job in real estate development. It queries three different Chicago transit APIs: the <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintracker/" target="_blank">CTA Train Tracker</a>, the <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker/" target="_blank">CTA Bus Tracker</a>, and the <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data" target="_blank">Divvy bikes API</a>. It also queries <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a> to get the local tempurature and weather conditions, which is displayed as a small animated weather icon on the bottom-right of the screen.

### Live Demo
A live demo of the dashboard can be found on my blog, link <a href="http://www.alexrdouglas.com/lobby-dashboard.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that it is designed to be fullscreen, so positioning may be a little wonky depending on your setup.
